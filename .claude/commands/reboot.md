You are about to perform a session reboot. This means generating a comprehensive handoff summary that will allow seamless continuation in a fresh context window.

Please create a detailed session summary that includes:

## Session Overview
- **Primary Goal/Task**: What we were working on
- **Current Status**: Where we left off and what stage we're at

## Key Learnings & Insights
- Important discoveries made during this session
- Technical insights or "aha moments"
- Any patterns or issues identified

## Decisions Made
- Architectural or design decisions
- Technology choices and rationale
- Implementation approaches chosen and why

## Progress Accomplished
- Features/components completed
- Files created or modified (with key changes)
- Tests written or configurations set up

## Current Context
- **Working Directory**: Current project structure
- **Key Files**: Most important files and their current state
- **Dependencies**: Libraries, tools, or external services involved
- **Environment**: Any specific setup or configuration details

## Next Steps
- Immediate next actions to take
- Specific tasks or features to implement
- Any blockers or considerations for next session

## Session Artifacts
- Code snippets that should be preserved
- Configuration details
- Commands or scripts that were useful
- Any URLs, documentation, or resources referenced

## Working Memory
- Variable names, function signatures, or conventions established
- Debugging approaches that worked/didn't work
- Performance considerations or optimization notes

**REBOOT INSTRUCTIONS FOR NEXT SESSION:**
Format the above as a self-contained prompt that would give a fresh Claude session everything needed to continue seamlessly. Include specific file paths, code examples, and enough context that no previous conversation history is needed.

After generating this summary:
1. **WAIT** - Let me review the summary before proceeding
2. I'll copy this summary for the next session
3. I'll run `/clear` to start fresh
4. I'll paste the summary to continue with full context
